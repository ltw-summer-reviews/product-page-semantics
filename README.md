## Details

- Approx. completion time: **2 hours**
- Deliverables: **1 HTML file, images**

Using the content and sketched wireframes provided, create a single HTML file that uses proper semantics to mark up the content.

*The look is **not** important. And no CSS is needed.*

Really consider the appropriate tags independent of how they look in the browser. Refer to the resources below to see if there are tags you have forgotten or didn’t realize exist to push the semantics further.

## Checklist

- ❏ Every piece of text is wrapped in an appropriate HTML element.
- ❏ HTML semantics are carefully considered to match the purpose of the content, not the look.
- ❏ Images use appropriate code for insertion.
- ❏ HTML & CSS properly validated.
- ❏ Has lots of detailed commits.
- ❏ No empty or “Untitled” `<title>` tags.
- ❏ No extra, unused files in the repository.
- ❏ Folders organized properly.
- ❏ Files & folders follow naming conventions.
- ❏ Code files properly indented.
- ❏ Set up as a hosted GitHub repository with `gh-pages`.
